# React Application Code Challenge

## Overview

In this challenge, you are expected to build a React application based on [this Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/JZyt0USoCGBmIfrEa2Y71t/Interview-UI-Design).

You would need to code the following:

1. Landing Page: the landing page will have a table that consolidates all music album data.
2. Album Details Page: Clicking the "View" button in any row should take the user to the second page which provides the specific album information.
3. Mock API Server: You are also expected to write your own mock API server which serves the data following the [API specification](./APIs.yml).
4. Bonus: Type Filters: Adding Type filters on the UI is an additional bonus.

## Timeline

Try to complete this within a week.

## Submission Instructions

- Please push your code (including the code to run the mock API server) to your **personal GitHub account** and share the repository link.

## Additional Instructions

- Libraries and Frameworks
  - Use the ReactJS library to build the application.
  - For routing between pages, React Router is recommended.
  - For the mock API server, we suggest using json-server, but you can use other alternatives like Express.js or a custom mock server solution.
- UI Design: Follow the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/JZyt0USoCGBmIfrEa2Y71t/Interview-UI-Design) as closely as possible. Replicate the layout, colors, and other styles.
